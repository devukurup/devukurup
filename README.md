# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Devu, a postgrad at UCL exploring the world of AI and Data Engineering.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been working with distributed systems, building scalable ML pipelines, and automating workflows that actually work.  
I enjoy solving complex problems, keeping my code clean, and occasionally chasing edge cases like theyâ€™re plot twists ðŸ§©

I believe good systems feel simple, even when they arenâ€™t.

Stick around. Things are always evolving ðŸª„
